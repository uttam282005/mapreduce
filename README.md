##  MapReduce in Go

This project is a **simplified MapReduce framework** implemented in Go — inspired by the [MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/) course.
It demonstrates how distributed computation can be performed by splitting work into **Map** and **Reduce** phases coordinated by a central **Coordinator** process and executed by multiple **Worker** processes.

---

##  Features

* ✅ Coordinator & Worker architecture with RPC communication
* ✅ Concurrent job scheduling and monitoring
* ✅ Fault-tolerant re-assignment of tasks (if worker fails or times out)
* ✅ Word count example using custom `mapF` and `reduceF` functions
* ✅ Threaded design: Coordinator and Worker run concurrently
* ✅ Modular code — easily plug in new Map/Reduce logic

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Coordinator

* Takes input files and splits them into **Map tasks**.
* Assigns tasks to available **Workers** through RPC calls.
* Tracks completion and transitions to **Reduce phase**.
* Calls `Done()` periodically to check if all jobs are finished.

### 2. Worker

* Connects to the coordinator via RPC.
* Requests work (`RequestTask`), executes map or reduce using user-defined functions.
* Writes intermediate files (`mr-X-Y`) for map outputs and merged files for reduce results.

### 3. Map & Reduce Functions

Defined in `main.go`:

```go
func mapF(filename string, contents string) []mr.KeyValue {
    // Splits text by whitespace and emits (word, "1") pairs
}

func reduceF(key string, values []string) string {
    // Returns the count of occurrences for each key
}
```

##  Running the Example

### 1️⃣ Build the Project

```bash
go build -o mapreduce .
```

### 2️⃣ Start the Coordinator

Run the coordinator with input files:

```bash
go run main.go coordinator -nreduce=3 input/pg-being_ernest.txt input/pg-grimm.txt input/pg-huckleberry.txt
```

This starts the **Coordinator** in a goroutine and monitors job completion via `Done()`.

### 3️⃣ Start Workers

In separate terminals (or as background processes):

```bash
go run main.go worker
```

Each worker connects to the coordinator and starts processing map/reduce tasks.

### 4️⃣ Wait for Completion

Once all tasks are finished:

```
Coordinator: all tasks finished
Coordinator exited cleanly
```

Output files will appear in your working directory (e.g., `mr-out-0`, `mr-out-1`, ...).

---

##  Example Output

```bash
cat mr-out-0
the 120
and 95
to 80
...
```

---

##  Concurrency Model

* **Coordinator** runs in the main process with a background goroutine checking `Done()`.
* **Worker** runs in its own goroutine to handle tasks concurrently.
* Communication happens via **Go’s RPC system**.
* The main thread sleeps periodically and exits only when all jobs are marked done.

##  Configuration Options

| Flag        | Description                 | Default  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | -------- |
| `-nreduce`  | Number of reduce tasks      | 3        |
| Input Files | List of files for map phase | Required |

---

##  Extending the Framework

You can implement your own computation by modifying `mapF` and `reduceF`.
For example:

* Word count → counting unique words
* Inverted index → mapping words to document lists
* Log analysis → grouping by IP or time range

Each new computation only requires changing the **Map** and **Reduce** logic — the coordinator and worker logic remains untouched.
